- Agreed-upon
- Reasonable
- Time-bound

Goal for Software Engineering department:
Increase the quality of software product named ABC by 20% (comparing to Feb 2017 release) by the end of August 2017.
The quality of each software release of ABC is measured by it's Quality Factor = (number of defects found in production use) per (1000 lines of code added or changed in the release).
Software Engineering is delivering new release every month and the quality metrics are collected for each release.
Also we have historical data for the releases that have been delivered within last few years.
The team is currently working on 3 different software products and two other products have Quality Factor higher than the goal target of ABC
Improvement of the product quality will:
- Increase our customer satisfaction (and as a result increase customer retention)
- Reduce development costs (fixing defects on later stages is much more expensive)
- Position or products as the best in the market (great marketing message, increase of sales)


Risks:
Engineering performance degradation. Engineers could become too cautious about the product changes they are making and thus spend unreasonable time double- and triple-thinking about
- Mitigation: 
Unethical behavior. It is possible to fake the Quality Factor improvement by adding "safe" unnecessary code lines. (1 defect per 1000 code lines compared to 1 defect per 1500 lines of code).
- Mitigation: Peer code reviews will make it less possible to fake code changes and will also improve the product 
Dissatisfaction: Quality improvement often involves a lot of rutine work suche as defect fixes which is less exciting for software engineers (comparing to the new functionality development). This can lead to lowered motivation.
- Mitigation: Feedback loop from the satisfied customers back to engineering. Provide clear vision of the quality metrics on every produced product release, show gradual improvement.

Strategies:
- Clearly communicate to all involved personal the impact of the product quality on business. Explain how achieving the goal will make the company closer to the company's long term goals.
- Explain to every involved team (product management, software development, QA, release management) how their respective team can influence the resulting product quality.
- Ask each involved team (product management, software development, QA, release management) to develop their own plan of actions on how their team to achieve the goal.
- Empower senior employees to mentor junior engineers.
- Provide continous feedback loop of release quality metrics to all involved personal.
